## Hello, World! :earth_americas:
Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is  and I'm a Computer Science enthusiast with a Bachelor's degree from Shanxi University. I have a deep passion for all things computer-related and I'm committed to dedicating my life to the computer industry.  :computer: :heart:

## Deep Learning  :brain:
I have a particular interest in Deep Learning. But I'm not satisfied with just being a hyperparameter tuner or a package user. I'm striving to dive deeper into the underlying algorithms and performance tuning. My goal is to make significant contributions to the field of Artificial Intelligence in the future. :rocket:

## High Performance Computing (HPC) 
In addition to my love for AI, I'm also a member of a supercomputing team, working on parallel computing. I believe that the combination of AI and HPC is the future, and I'm on a journey to find my true calling in this AI+HPC domain.  :dart:

## Let's Connect! 
I'm always open to collaborating on projects and innovative/disruptive ideas. Feel free to contact me on QQ or drop me an email at 3027026585@qq.com.



Remember, the best way to predict the future is to create it. So let's create a future together!  :muscle: :fire:
